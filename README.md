# Turtle-Plotter
I started learning python mid-june and I came across the turtle graphics library and suddenly felt insipired by 2007 memories of lego mindstorms plotters! So I set about creating this little project to help me develop and apply what I had been learning about python. It works on the principle that each character has a set of instructions and instruction values that correspond to the functions of turtle.py. These are stored in strings inside a dictionary, and the computer will read through the instructions and carry them out! 

I started this at the end of June so I could learn python, once I had the A being printed I took a ~definitely not needed break from learning new skills~ and left the rest of the adding of characters! Turns out only took a couple of days to add the rest of the alphabet. 

This isn't very good or feature full, I would like to have it not split words onto new lines, so maybe one day I will add that and some punctuation and digits into the script.

For fun I have added photos of some of the ""advanced"" maths I used to work out the angles and circles of shapes! Big thankyou to GCSE maths on that one!
